# 🏗️ Microservices Architecture Roadmap

## 🎯 Current State vs Target Microservices

### ❌ Current: Modular Monolith

```
Frontend → Backend (All APIs) → Single Database
           ↓
        Chatbot
```

### ✅ Target: True Microservices

```
Frontend → API Gateway → Auth Service     → Auth DB
                    → Invoice Service  → Invoice DB
                    → Template Service → Template DB
                    → OCR Service      → OCR DB
                    → Analytics Service → Analytics DB
                    → Chat Service     → Chat DB
```

## 🚀 Migration Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Service Extraction

1. **Auth Service** (Highest Priority)

   - Extract `/api/auth` from backend
   - Own PostgreSQL database for users
   - JWT token issuer
   - Port: 5002

2. **Invoice Service** (Core Business)

   - Extract `/api/invoices` from backend
   - Own database for invoices
   - Port: 5003

3. **Template Service**
   - Extract `/api/templates`
   - Own database for templates
   - Port: 5004

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Services

4. **OCR Service**

   - Extract `/api/ocr`
   - Async processing with message queue
   - Port: 5005

5. **Analytics Service**
   - Extract `/api/analytics`
   - Read-only replicas from other services
   - Port: 5006

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

6. **API Gateway**

   - Route requests to appropriate services
   - Authentication middleware
   - Rate limiting
   - Port: 5000 (replace current backend)

7. **Message Broker** (Redis/RabbitMQ)

   - Async communication between services
   - Event-driven architecture

8. **Service Discovery** (Consul/Eureka)
   - Dynamic service registration
   - Health checking
   - Load balancing

## 📊 Benefits of Migration

### Performance

- ✅ Independent scaling per service
- ✅ Parallel processing
- ✅ Reduced resource contention

### Development

- ✅ Team autonomy per service
- ✅ Independent deployments
- ✅ Technology diversity

### Reliability

- ✅ Fault isolation
- ✅ Circuit breakers
- ✅ Redundancy

## 🛠️ Implementation Example

### New docker-compose.microservices.yml

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  # Infrastructure
  api-gateway:
    build: ./api-gateway
    ports: ["5000:5000"]

  message-broker:
    image: redis:alpine
    ports: ["6379:6379"]

  # Business Services
  auth-service:
    build: ./services/auth
    ports: ["5002:5002"]
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://auth_db

  invoice-service:
    build: ./services/invoices
    ports: ["5003:5003"]
    environment:
      - DATABASE_URL=postgresql://invoice_db

  # Databases per service
  auth-db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: auth_db

  invoice-db:
    image: postgres:15
    environment:
      POSTGRES_DB: invoice_db
```

## 🔧 Migration Commands

### Step 1: Create Auth Service

```bash
mkdir services/auth
cp -r backend/routes/auth.py services/auth/
cp backend/models/user.py services/auth/models/
# Create separate Flask app
```

### Step 2: Update Frontend

```typescript
// Before: Single backend
const API_BASE = "http://localhost:5000/api";

// After: Service-specific endpoints
const AUTH_API = "http://localhost:5002/api";
const INVOICE_API = "http://localhost:5003/api";
const TEMPLATE_API = "http://localhost:5004/api";
```

## ⚠️ Challenges to Consider

1. **Data Consistency**: Distributed transactions
2. **Network Latency**: Service-to-service calls
3. **Complexity**: More moving parts
4. **Testing**: Integration testing becomes harder
5. **Monitoring**: Need distributed tracing

## 📈 Recommended Approach

**Option 1: Gradual Migration** (Recommended)

- Start with extracting Auth Service
- Keep existing backend as API Gateway initially
- Migrate one service at a time

**Option 2: Big Bang Migration**

- Risk: High complexity, potential downtime
- Benefit: Clean architecture immediately

## 🎯 Decision Framework

**Stay with current architecture if:**

- ✅ Team size < 5 people
- ✅ Simple business domain
- ✅ Performance is adequate
- ✅ Deployment complexity concerns

**Migrate to Microservices if:**

- ✅ Team size > 10 people
- ✅ Complex business domain
- ✅ Need independent scaling
- ✅ Different technology requirements per domain
